# AE2-Software-Engineering
AE2 group project for software engineering

"Before the start of each term or semester, the class directors produce a
list of teaching requirements which we must try and fill. Our administrator
will then attempt to find suitable staff and organise training for them."

You should use an Agile approach to designing your software and Trello to communicate between
team members. You should design appropriate User Stories, but they do not have to be the same
as your stories from AE1. Please only include stories related to the limited part of the software
described above.
